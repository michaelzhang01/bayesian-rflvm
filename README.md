# Latent Variable Modeling with Random Features

This library is a Python implementation of random feature latent variable models (RFLVMs), which are a family of nonlinear dimension reduction methods that use random Fourier features to support non-Gaussian data likelihoods. RFLVMs were developed by [Gregory Gundersen](http://gregorygundersen.com/), [Michael Zhang](https://michaelzhang01.github.io/), and [Barbara Engelhardt](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bee/). See [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11145) for details.

This library was written by Gregory Gundersen. Please feel free to submit any bugs requests.

# Background

Gaussian process-based latent variable models are flexible and theoretically grounded tools for nonlinear dimension reduction, but generalizing to non-Gaussian data likelihoods within this nonlinear framework is statistically challenging. The main problem is that a non-Gaussian likelihood cannot be integrated out in closed form. Here, we use random features to develop a family of nonlinear dimension reduction models that are easily extensible to non-Gaussian data likelihoods; we call these random feature latent variables models (RFLVMs). By approximating a nonlinear relationship between the latent space and the observations with a function that is linear with respect to random features, we induce closed-form gradients of the posterior distribution with respect to the latent variable. This means we can use gradient-based methods, such as quasi-Newton methods or HMC, to optimize our posterior w.r.t. the latent variables. This allows the RFLVM framework to support computationally tractable nonlinear latent variable models for a variety of data likelihoods in the exponential family without specialized derivations.

# Demo

To replicate results in the paper, call `fit_model.py` with appropriate arguments. The datasets `bridges`, `congress`, and `s-curve` are supported here. For example, to replicate the Poisson model, call

```bash
python fit_model.py --dataset=s-curve --emissions=poisson --model=poisson
```

This uses Scikit-learn's `make_s_curve` function to generate latent variables in the shape of an "S" and then generates data according to the data generating process described in the paper. To see the data generating process in code, see [here](https://github.com/gwgundersen/rflvm/blob/master/datasets/loader.py#L71). See the `ArgumentParser` instance in `fit_model.py` for a description of arguments.
